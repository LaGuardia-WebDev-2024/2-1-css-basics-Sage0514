    <h1>The coolest creature</h1>
    <p>The <em>otter</em> is awesome because <strong>they're so cuddly, friendly and loving towards each other.</strong>. 
      They're semi-equatic and live in groups with one another.
      Actually, the word "otter" came from old English from the root word for water. 
      Another fact is they need to constantly move to trap air for insulation and keep theitr fur fluffy.</p>
